# Project Title: Linear Regression Analysis

Hello!

I'm excited to give you a deep dive into my project on Linear Regression. Here's a detailed walkthrough of linear regression where I have explained the core concepts, relevant terminologies, and important formulas.

## What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is one of the fundamental algorithms in the Machine Learning toolbox. It is a statistical analysis for predicting the value of a quantitative variable. In simpler words, it helps us predict outcomes based on a set of independent variables.

## Definitions

The key concepts concerning linear regression include the following:

- **Linear Equation**: In its simplest form, a linear equation can be written as _Y = mx + b_, where Y is the dependent variable we're trying to predict, x is our independent variable, m is the slope of the line (coefficient), b is the y-intercept.

- **Cost Function**: The cost function (also called loss function or error function) measures how well the regression line represents the dataset. The lower the value, the better. For linear regression, we typically use the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the cost function. It is defined as the average of all squared differences between the predicted and actual values.

- **Gradient Descent**: This is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function. It works iteratively to move the function towards the minimum value. It starts with random values for parameters (m and b), computes the cost function, and uses calculus to determine the next set of parameters, gradually approaching the minimum.

## The Maths

The formula for the linear regression model is:

    Y = Wx + b 

Where:
- Y is the predicted output,
- W is the weight vector,
- x is the input vector, and
- b is the bias term.

The goal is to iteratively adjust the values of W and b to minimize the cost function.

The Gradient Descent formula:

    W_new = W_old - learning_rate * (derivative of the cost function w.r.t W)

    b_new = b_old - learning_rate * (derivative of the cost function w.r.t b)
    
    
The learning_rate is a hyperparameter which determines how much the model parameters can change in a single step.

The derivative of the cost function with respect to W and b, gives the direction of the fastest increase of the function. We move in the opposite direction (hence the minus sign) to go towards the minimum.

## Wrap up

There you have it - a thorough baseline understanding of what linear regression aims to do, the key concepts behind it and the corresponding technical definitions. In the end, we are trying to fit the best line to predict our output using the technique of minimizing errors between the actual and predicted values!

Stay tuned for more exciting deep-dives into the world of Machine Learning. Happy coding!
